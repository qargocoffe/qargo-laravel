Starting with the city of Tampa, Qargo Coffee is joining this vibrant, coastal community to serve new customers its signature high-quality coffee and irresistible pastries.\n\nAnd that’s precisely what makes Qargo Coffee stand out from their competitors across the USA: Offering something more than a delicious coffee, but rather, a whole premium product menu, outstanding customer experience, breathtaking design for each store and much more.\n\n“We’re proud to open in the wonderful Sunshine State of Florida in the well known area of Tampa. The State of Florida has become home to families that have relocated in the last 2 years because of the endless opportunities it offers. We’re looking forward to serving the Tampa community with future expansion to other parts of Florida soon” – said Sebastian Garcia, Director of Marketing for\nQargo Coffee.\n\nBut the secret to their impressive expansion and growth is not only in Qargo’s philosophy, to “Empower the Creators”, it is also in their partnership with Lavazza: the 125-year-old Italian Coffee Powerhouse that provides all the ingredients and recipes to serve a phenomenal product; and bring the fine-dining coffee experience into every day moments for each customer, whether at breakfast, lunch or anytime, Qargo Coffee will be sure to satisfy.\n\n“The great quality of our products, the 24/7 team support, and the friendly work environment were the key factors for choosing Qargo Coffee. My goal was also to add value to the consumer experience; in the past, if you wanted to enjoy a cup of Lavazza coffee, you needed to go to a five-star hotel. Now, there’s an opportunity of having a premium product near you. Creating that reality inspired me to invest, not only in one but nine locations across the Tampa Bay area, hoping to one day transform Qargo Coffee Tampa into a landmark.” – said Issam Ozeir, franchisee for Qargo Coffee, Tampa.\n\nQargo Coffee top-tier experience goes beyond traditional service and customizes each store menu (https://issuu.com/qargocoffee/docs/qctampamenu) according to the market needs and likes. For the Tampa store, located at International Plaza and Bay Street mall, the brand is inaugurating an alliance with Lotus Energy Drinks, offering customers a unique and healthy plant-based boost of energy. Besides that, the Tampa menu includes premium Bindi desserts and pastries, inspired by top flavors of Italian tradition, complementing a wide variety of grab and go options, like fresh sandwiches, wraps, salads and snacks.\n\nThe Big Guava residents are cordially invited to try first hand the Qargo Coffee experience and share the premium taste of Lavazza.
